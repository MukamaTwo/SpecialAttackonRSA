# SpecialAttackonRSA
Cryptographic attack that applies to the case in which the same message is encrypted using RSA to three different recipients.
The goal here is to use the three eavesdropped ciphertexts (in the .txt file) to recover the secret message -ASCII encoding of a name you should know ;)
